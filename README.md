# go---crud---api
A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built entirely in a single main.go file using Go (Golang) and Gorilla Mux. This project provides a simple RESTful API to manage movie records. It supports operations such as fetching all movies, retrieving a movie by ID, adding a new movie, updating a movie, and deleting a movie.
